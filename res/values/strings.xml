Have you ever forgotten to plug in your phone at night to find your
phone\'s battery dead the next day?  If so, then <i>Always Charged</i> is for you.
Just set the time to your regular bedtime, and if
you remember to plug in your phone, nothing will happen.  However, if you
forget, an alarm will sound, reminding you to charge your phone.\n\n

This is not just a simple alarm.  It waits patiently and silently snoozes the alarm
if you are using your phone, moving around, or already have it plugged in and charging.\n\n
