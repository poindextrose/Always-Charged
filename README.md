# Introduction

This was my first Android project. I was exploring mobile development and found and idea that I wanted to pursue. It hasn't been maintained in many years, but it is still available on the app store.

# Description

If your device is not plugged in, not in use, and not moving at bedtime, this app will remind you to plug in before you fall asleep and wake to a low or dead battery. 

It works best if you schedule the alarm for your normal bedtime. If you want to schedule an alarm that repeats for more than one day, set different bedtimes, or customize other actions, then you should upgrade to the professional version in the app.

# Install
